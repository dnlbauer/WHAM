about: |
  wham is a fast implementation of the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) written in Rust. It currently supports potential of mean force (PMF) calculations in multiple dimensions at constant temperature.

  Metadata file format:
      /path/to/timeseries_file1  x_1  x_2  x_N  fc_1  fc_2  fc_N
      /path/to/timeseries_file2  x_1  x_2  x_N  fc_1  fc_2  fc_N
      /path/to/timeseries_file3  x_1  x_2  x_N  fc_1  fc_2  fc_N
  The first column is a path to a timeseries file _relative_ to the metadata file (see below). This is followed by the position of the umbrella potential x in N dimensions and the force constant fc in each dimension. Lines starting with a # are treated as comments and will not be parsed.

  Timeseries file format:
      time  x_1  x_2  x_N
      time  x_1  x_2  x_N
      time  x_1  x_2  x_N
  The first column will be ignored and is followed by N reaction coordinates x.
